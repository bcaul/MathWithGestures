# Math with Gestures using AI

The Math with Gestures project allows the user to interact with a system where they can draw using gestures, and the AI will process and understand what they are doing. 
It can do a variety of things, for example, 
the user could could draw a math equation which the AI will solve, or the user could even draw something and have the AI guess what the drawing is.
